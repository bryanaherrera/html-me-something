                    <p>I throughly enjoyed this concert. I was a big fan of One Direction in middle school and it shocked me to know 
                            that Harry Styles was real and was singing and danccing in the same building. Harry delivered a fun concert
                            with a ton of dancing and fan interaction.

                    <p>I didn't now who Logic was until my high school friends invited me to join them for a concert he was doing in St.Louis.
                        That was one of my most memorabe trips I took from high school. Logic likes to interact with the crowd and invites people on stage to 
                        challenge them in speed rappig his songs and to play mario kart.

                    <p>I discovered Jessie when I was scrolling on Youtube for new music and instantly fell in love with the way she sings with such emotion.
                        Love going to her concerts she puts so much energy out that is recoperate by the crowd. When she came to Rogers, Arkansas she wasn't
                        the main act but I went to the venue early to get a good spot in pit to see her perform. She saw me in line when her bus pulled in because 30
                        minutes before doors opened someone on her team came to give me free tickets for my friends.

                    <p>Brother Moses is a local band from Fayetteville, AR. They preformed in an event in my hometown, Springdale, and let me tell you it was
                        one of the best concerts. They didn't have fancy lights or a large crowd but they were having fun with the crowd that was there.
                        In one point of the show one of the guitarsman got off the stage and the other guitarsman got on top of his shoulders and they were
                        just playing, vibing.

                    <p>This day was crazy. I locked my keys in my car, had to call a lcksmith. Got let in early as an accident and had to wait and then run down to pit to get barricade.
                        It was in the middle of the hottest time of the year. But it was all well because Chance put on a great show, loved the graphics, the dancing, the energy, overall 
                        great concert.

                    <p>I saw Lany twice, both in Little Rock. The first time was a spontaneous go, my friend and I decided to go to have a break and lt loose from the stress of finals week. 
                        The second time they played at the outdoor festival in Little Rock. Lany has a song calld Pink Skies and they played it under a Little Rock pink sky (not pictured).</p>
